What is the difference between TCP (Transmission Control) and UDP (User Datagram) connections?

        TCP connections: Are more secure, yet slower than UDP. TCP links transmitter to receiver until data can be transmitted.
        Receiver retrieves data packets (segments) and send back data if lost in transit. TCP monitors error packages and track them in order to
        prevent data from being lost or corrupted. Lies between application and network layers. TCP header size is 20 - 60 bytes.
        Sends acknowledgement. SYN - client to server. ACK - server to client. SYN-ACK - acknowledgement of the SYN-ACK. This is
        commonly referred to as 'three-way handshake'. TCP is more common and HTTP is built on TCP.

        UDP 'connections': Are less secure, yet faster than TCP. UDP is connectionless. There is no acknowledgement when data
        delivery is done. UDP is used for gaming, streaming and applications that require lightning fast communication.

What is the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model?

        Layer 7 (application): High level protocol for resource sharing (HTTP) or remote file access.

        Layer 6 (presentation): Translation of data between a networking service and an application: character encoding, data compression,
        and encryption/decryption.

        Layer 5 (session): Continuous exchange of information in the form of back and forth transmission between two nodes.

        Layer 4 (transport): Reliable transmission of data segments between points on a network, including segmentation, acknowledgement,
        and multiplexing. TCP and UDP.

        Layer 3 (network): Structuring and managing a multi-node network, including addressing routing and traffic control.

        Layer 2 (data link): Transmission of data frames between two nodes connected by a physical layer.

        Layer 1 (physical): Transmission and reception of raw bit streams over a physical medium. Hardware.

What happens when you visit a website?

        1. Web browser contacts DNS server and translates domain name address back into IP address of the web server.

        2. Browser will use IP address returned by DNS and connect to port 80 on web server using TCP.

        3. Once browser and webserver are connected, browser will retrieve the HTML code of the requested page.

        4. Once browser receives HTML code, it will render code onto browser window.

        5. When window is closed, the connection will end.

What is the difference between A name and C name records?

        A NAME record: Contains information about which IP address is associated with a domain.

        CNAME record: Contains information about aliases to web addresses. For example: example.com for www.example.com

What is a public subnet?

        A public subnet is a subnet that is associated with a Route Table that has a route to an Internet Gateway. The
        public subnet can then access the internet.

What is a private subnet?

        A private subnet is a subnet associated with a route table that doesn't have a route to an internet gateway. The
        private subnet cannot communicate with the public internet. AWS resource within the same VPC CIDR block can
        communicate via their private IP addresses. However, resources in a private subnet can access the internet
        with an Igw.

###### General encryption: ######

What is the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption?

        Symmetric encryption: Uses a single key to encrypt and decrypt info. Faster than asymmetric but must be shared
        with the recipient, which means that they have the possibility of getting stolen.

        Asymmetric encryption: Uses two keys: public and private key. Uses more resources and more efficient for small data.

        Envelope encryption: Encrypt plaintext data with a data key, encrypting data key with another key.

What is the difference between an IAM role and an IAM policy?

         IAM role: An IAM role is an identity created in AWS and be assigned specific permissions.

         IAM policy: An IAM policy is a document with a set of rules. Policies are attached to IAM identities like Users,
         Groups, and Roles.

What is the difference between Aurora and RDS?

         Aurora is reliable and fault-tolerant by design. DB storage is separate from instances and data has 6 copies to
         3 AZs.

         RDS is similar to installing a db engine on EC2 and is not highly available by default.
